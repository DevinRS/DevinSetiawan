    This semester my co-worker, who happens to be the president of Jayhawk Aero Design, invited me to JAD. The goal of JAD is to win AIAA plane design competition where we build working rc plane and try to be the best amongst participating universities. Upon this intriguing idea, I decided to join the data science team to help bring KU its long deserved victory. Check out my website that I built to help achieve this goal!

    My roommate introduced me to this amazing boardgame (RIP Klaus Teuber 1952-2023) that consist of conquering, trading, and a lot more awesome mechanics. This game is played with 4 players where the goal of the game is to be the first to reach 10 points. Being the competitive person that I am, I decided to analyze the game and come up with data-driven strategy that gives me an edge over my roommates. Check out my analysis above and win more games for yourself!! üí™

    This is the project I did alongside my 5 teammates for Software Engineering 1 course. Working on the project, I was exposed to the process of agile development and truly experienced how developing a software feels like. I'm the lead programmer and throughout the sprint, I felt the experience of having to learn a totaly new and unfamiliar tool, Godot Game Engine. At the end of the project, we managed to deploy our working puzzle game. Try it out! It's quite fun üòä

As a class assistant and tutor, I played an active role in teaching the student one-to-one, tailoring to each individual need to ensure they're able to succeed in learning the material. With the desk assistant position, I ensure documents are updated and where they're suppose to be. I also need to make sure that the communication line between the student and KAP is accessible. As a supervisor, I've learned to manage people and be a leader.

Being a teacher first hand have taught me the true value of teaching. When you have to teach one-on-one, you really need to tailor your approach to the student you're teaching. In my opinion, this is the art in teaching. There's no guidebook or fixed methods to teach someone how to learn a material. Sure, there are some guideline you can follow but ultimately, you'll always need to adapt and adjust in the process.
